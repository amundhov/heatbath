parameters.h
 - Simulation parameters needed by main.cpp and compute.cpp

simulation.cpp
 - Definitin of of simulation object doing the actual work.

compute.cpp
 - Link with this to make a stand-alone exectuable which samples to file and
   shuts down cleanly when killed.

g++ -o compute compute.cpp simulation.cpp -lgsl -lgslcblas

main.cpp
 - Main routine for visualizing the evolution of the interface.

g++ -o visualize main.cpp simulation.cpp -lgsl -lgslcblas -lGL -lglut

aggregate.cpp
 - Routine for doing arithmetic mean of simulation files produced by
   compute.cpp and main.cpp

g++ -o aggregate aggregate.cpp -lm
